				The Race studied the last surviving Sea Emperor Leviathan in hopes of finding a cure using its natural production of Enzyme 42. However, due to its weakness, possibly old age or illness, studies conducted showed that it was not a viable source of Enzyme 42 as the enzymes it produced was too unstable and only reverted symptoms temporarily. After the Precursors Race could not find a way to hatch its eggs naturally, they took three into the dissection room of the Primary Containment Facility and experimented on them, cutting all of them open and removing the fetus from one of the eggs. One other egg was taken to the egg lab, where it was also tested on. Still, they could find no way to cause the hatching process to trigger naturally, and juveniles born outside of the natural conditions could not produce suitable enzymes. They resorted to attaching the eggs to an Incubator Device to keep the eggs alive while they worked on more ways to hatch them. Shortly after this, the Disease Research Facility was destroyed, releasing the Kharaa Bacterium, causing all Arches to the facility to be closed and initiating the planetary quarantine.

As the leviathans mature and become too large for their home, they migrate to the open, surface world biomes such as the Grand Reef and Blood Kelp Zone, consuming Ampeels and Crabsquids in the Northern Blood Kelp, and shoals of fish and possibly even Sea Treader Leviathans in the Grand Reef, until eventually migrating to the Crater Edge, roaming freely in the open water and constantly growing larger until they die.[1][2] Despite being much smaller than the Sea Emperor Leviathan, the Ghost Leviathan's eggs can be far larger, capable of growing to sizes far too large for the creature to lay, suggesting that the eggs can grow drastically after being laid.

				Sinicizer, a high-pressure profession. Sinicizers may have to bear the slander of game companies and a group of Hypocrites .In a short time, many Sinicization groups can also do it, but how many of them can do the same as what CHBCLive has done for three years , releasing Sinicized patches at once ? Nobody. CHBCLive's translation is even more detailed than the official . Using tools, he translated those obscure professional terms one by one. Three years, nearly a thousand days and nights of sweat, he didn't ask for anything in return. If he did, it might be the call "Master" from his supporters.

In the production of each video, though suffering from great pain, he just suffered and never told anyone else.
