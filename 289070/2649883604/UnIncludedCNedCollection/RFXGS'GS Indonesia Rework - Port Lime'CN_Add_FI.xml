It controlled the remainder of the archipelago indirectly, collecting tributes from various vassal powers.

			<Text>“加查·玛达”意为大象将军，作为印尼民族英雄和爱国主义的象征，14世纪时他作为首相的这段岁月是印尼历史上最强大的时期。有关他幼年和成长经历的记录存留很少，只知道他出生于平民家庭，靠着机智狡猾上位，并且在战场上心狠手辣。作为一个国王侍卫，他帮助镇压了叛乱，从此步入了统治阶层，最终登上首相宝座。加查·玛达领导满者伯夷盛极一时，兼并了许多周围的岛国，奠定了现代印尼的版图。</Text>
			<!-- In modern times, Gajah Mada’s name is synonymous with shrewdness, brilliance, and peerless leadership. Up to modern times, he was a leader that many have sought to emulate, and just as Queen Gitarja often was carried on the back of an enormous war elephant into battle, the Kingdom of Majapahit as a whole was carried by this mighty Elephant General (the translation of ‘Gajah Mada’) into its Golden Age. However, while Gajah Mada is best known for being the peerless and shrewd Mahapatih – or Prime Minister – of the Majapahit Empire under Queen Gitarja and King Hayam Wuruk, the actual start of his career was as the commander of the royal guard under Gitarja’s predecessor, Jayanegara. -->

			<Text>加查·玛达最早出现在历史中是在他的成年时代，作为国王查耶纳卡拉（1309-1328在位）的侍卫队长。期间，满者伯夷官员古蒂反叛并控制了都城，加查·玛达知悉了阴谋，护送国王躲到了临近的城市巴丹德尔。在确保国王的安全以后，加查玛达假传国王已死的谣言，瓦解的叛军的斗志，同时组织了军队一举夺回了首都，助国王复位。加查·玛达发现军队对国王的死讯非常吃惊，古蒂也因此失去了军队的支持，其在镇压中丧生，而加查·玛达也因在这次事件中出色的表现也得到奖赏。</Text>
			<!-- Jayanegara’s reign was a troubled one, due to circumstances both in and out of his control. The empire that was founded by Jayanegara’s father was primed to revolt upon Jayanegara’s ascent to the throne, as Jayanegara’s mother was Sumatran, not Javanese, and considered to be of much lower station than the other queens of more powerful families to boot. Furthermore, Jayanegara was a man of poor behavior and great vice. Often, he would lust after his own half-sisters, while simultaneously placing them under custody so make sure there would be no claimants. Worse still, he desired many of the wives of his own officials and subordinates. During the Kuti rebellion, when Jayanegara was chased out of the capital city of Trowulan, he had but 25 Palace Guards to defend him. The leader of these was none other than Gajah Mada. Against the odds, Gajah Mada infiltrated the capital, and spread rumors that the king had died, to see who celebrated and who mourned. When Jayanegara finally stormed the capital and returned to the throne, those who celebrated his death quickly found themselves without their heads. -->

			<Text>根据传说，若干年后加查·玛达被国王抢了老婆，他怀恨在心，撺唆一个曾经支持古蒂的御医趁给国王看病的时候将其谋害，得逞后又卸磨杀驴。不管真相如何，查耶纳卡拉死后，他的拖油瓶妹妹翠布瓦娜·维贾亚通加登上王位，立志扩张国土。加查·玛达深受女王信任，1329年，他被任命为“麻喏巴歇巴迪”（首相）。权柄在握的加查·玛达也将自己的命运同国家联系在一起，把目光瞄准了国家的边疆。他在流传于世演绎出许多版本的帕拉帕誓言中说到，假如我无法征服所有已知的岛屿，我就不会品尝水果香料和凡间的享乐。</Text>
			<!-- And yet, Jayanegara seems to have learned nothing of this incident. In 1328, he was murdered by his doctor during a minor operation, as Jayanegara had dishonored the doctor’s wife. Fortunately, Gajah Mada was close at hand, and slew the doctor. Coincidentally, the king did not survive this mortal wound. This becomes increasingly coincidental as one learns that Gajah Mada was close friends with Jayanegara’s heir, one of the sisters he had locked up. However, as she had taken holy orders she was disqualified from inheriting the throne, so it passed to her daughter Gitarja - a girl that Gajah Mada had mentored from childhood and trusted Gajah Mada like a father. Even more coincidentally, Gajah Mada’s own wife numbered in the women that Jayanegara had dishonored. Unrelatedly, Gajah Mada had killed the assassin before a full investigation into the motives and events could be discerned. -->

			<Text>1331年，加查·玛达前往位于东爪哇的萨登镇压叛乱，凯旋而归不久后，就开始着手征服周边的岛屿。1343年，巴厘和龙目最先被收入囊中。他为了人民的荣耀而战，逐步攻占各个王国与部落，地区和城市，包括了位于巨港的佛教国家三佛齐和西苏门答腊的一些小王国，扶植了一个满者伯夷的王公作为附庸。随后大象将军又让印尼最早的伊斯兰国家苏木都剌臣服，接着，他在两年间又征服了6个王国与城市，包括海峡对岸的淡马锡（今新加坡）。</Text>
			<!-- Gitarja became the regent for her own son, Hayam Wuruk, and she immediately appointed Gajah Mada to his post of Mahapatih. Upon entering the office Gajah Mada swore the Sumpah Palapa an oath, that no spice would pass his lips (possibly a euphemism for abstaining from all earthly pleasures, though this could also be taken literally) until all the domains of Nusantara (the Indonesian Archipelago) were brought under the auspices of the court in Trowulan. One of Gajah Mada’s rivals ridiculed him over the preposterous nature of this dream, an insult that allowed Gajah Mada to duel and kill him. Gajah Mada conveniently had no other rivals in court. The next nineteen years of Gitarja’s reign saw the meteoric rise of Majapahit’s power, all thanks to Gajah Mada. Pursuing a mix of diplomacy and combat, he was able to bring almost the entirety of modern Indonesia under the vassalage of Majapahit. -->

			<!-- When Gitarja resigned her regency so that her son, Hayam Wuruk, could take the throne, few holdouts remained against Majapahit hegemony. One of the most notable controlled the western third of Majapahit’s home island of Java, the kingdom of Sunda. After years of rivalry, Majapahit finally arrived at a compromise with Sunda – a marriage between Hayam Wuruk and a princess of Sunda. However, when the royal family of Sunda arrived in the palace complex of Majapahit, they were met with a thousand elite soldiers and Gajah Mada clad in golden armor. Gajah Mada informed them that they had misunderstood. The princess of Sunda would not be a queen, rather a concubine. Just so, Sunda would not be an equal partner, but a mere vassal. Rather than simply pray that Gajah Mada wouldn’t alter the deal further, a fight broke out in the capital, and Gajah Mada did not hesitate to slaughter the entire royal family of Sunda, as the princess committed suicide. Sunda, horrified, would never become a part of the kingdom of Majapahit and his name is still reviled where Sunda was to the modern day. For his part, Hayam Wuruk stripped Gajah Mada of his title, and he spent the rest of his life codifying law at his estate in East Java. -->

			<Text>1357年，加查·玛达已经打下了近十个岛屿，他发现他面临着一个强劲的对手，仅存的几个独立王国之一——位于西爪哇的巽他。尽管双方已决定让巽他公主和武禄王联姻，加查·玛达仍然在寻求吞并巽他的办法。加查·玛达坚持巽他公主只能做武禄王的妾而不是王后，以此激怒巽他。在布巴特镇的婚礼上，双方的协商从争吵变成了打斗，加查·玛达和他的士兵杀害了巽他王室和王室卫队。过激的鲁莽行为损害了加查·玛达的形象，廷臣们指责他嗜血且残忍，国王也因此剥夺了他的头衔权力和荣誉。这个帝国最有权力的人物在东爪哇孤独度过余生，约在1363年默默死去。</Text>
			<!-- Despite this shocking incident, Gajah Mada was the most powerful individual who ever held office in the Kingdom of Majapahit. His stewardship not only saw the explosive expansion of the kingdom, but the increasing Javanisation and Hindunisation of Java and her vassals, as well as the imprinting of Majapahit in the memory of the region for centuries to come, and for better or worse the memory of a Java-centered Indonesia. It was the legacy of this one man that would become the groundwork for the Republic of Indonesia six hundred years later. -->
