			<Text>【译者注：正在翻译……】[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A son of King Mongkut by a lesser royal wife, Prince Damrong Rajanubhab was a younger half-brother of King Chulalongkorn. He was the founder of modern education and provincial administration and was Thailand’s leading intellectual of his generation. Damrong himself had only four years of formal education in short-lived palace Thai and English schools founded by King Chulalongkorn for his brothers in the early 1870s. Following this schooling he joined the Royal Pages’ Bodyguard Regiment to prepare for a military career. When he became head of the regiment in 1880, at the age of 18, he found that the sons of royalty and nobility passing through the pages’ corps were being ill-prepared for military and bureaucratic careers and so founded Suan Kulap (Rose Garden Palace) School in 1881. In 1885 an education department was created under Damrong’s control, which in 1887 was made a separate department of government and in 1892 a ministry.</Text>

			<Text>Damrong was slated to become the minister of education in 1892 but instead, because of his exceptional ability, was appointed Minister of the Interior (or “Minister of the Mahatthai” in Thai), the most powerful position in the bureaucracy. He modernized what had been a decentralized system of provincial administration by grouping almost 100 provinces into only 14 “circles,” each staffed by modern-educated young officers and royal commissioners, thus quickly ending provincial autonomy. Damrong’s officers collected taxes, controlled leasing for the extraction of natural resources, and introduced modern law and education.</Text>

He took a leading role in preserving and publishing the traditional texts of Thai literature and history, and he was one of the founders of the Siam Society and the National Library. Damrong went into exile in Pinang after the 1932 revolution. He was the author of more than 1,000 books and articles in various fields.</Text>

Headed by Prince Damrong, the reforms transformed the country from a decentralized system of semi-independent tributary cities into a centralized nation-state in line with the nations of the West. The reforms merged almost 100 provinces into only 14 “Monthons” (literally “circles”), obliterating the power of local lords and even tributary kings, and forcing taxes into the central government’s purse, rather than those of the local lords. Such a major change did not occur without incident, and revolts sprang up in both the Lanna and Isan regions; though they were ultimately suppressed—rebels armed with only local weapons and holy water were no match for the government’s Gatling guns and cannons.</Text>

Many amongst the royalty and nobility of Siam, understood that to avoid colonisation, the nation would have to demonstrate their right to rule by adapting to the model of the nation-state that was dominant in the West, as well as adapting certain cultural norms. By self-initialising the process of Westernisation, Siam was able to define for itself what it meant to be “Siwilai”. Siam adopted Western technologies, such as the railroad and the telegraph. It reformed its systems of administration (see the Monthon Reforms). It strengthened its cultural and national identity both at home and abroad, participating in numerous World’s Fairs starting with one in 1867 in Paris. Siam also managed to reject a number of Western cultural standards, such as Christianity (it clung to Theravada Buddhism), and monogamy (though Thailand would reject polygamy early in the 20th century).</Text>

As Siam was threatened by Western expansionism, Chulalongkorn, through his policies and acts, managed to save Siam from colonisation.

			<Text>Born September 20, 1853, King Rama V was to inherit the throne from his father, King Monkut (Rama IV), in 1868 at the tender age of 15. Because he was still a child, Thailand was governed by regency for the first five years of his reign and the boy King took advantage of the time to travel the world. His father had been one of Siam's most educated monarchs, recognizing the need for education and also the importance of the western world, yet understanding fully the threat of colonization. Wisely, he had instilled these principles in his son who was an apt student. During those first five years, King Chulalongkorn visited most of the major western powers, learning about their cultures, traditions, political organization and technology while in neighboring countries he spent time making political friends, realizing the need for allies in the fight to prevent colonization.</Text>

			<Text>With the support of his brothers and young friends, the King began, in 1873, to attack the injustices of the old order and the power of his political rivals by attempting to impose centralized budgeting and accounting, streamlining a judicial system beset by delays and corruption, and inaugurating consultative legislative councils dominated by his young friends. These actions, accompanied by a decline in Wichaichan's prospects, brought on the ""Front Palace Crisis"" of early 1875, when Wichaichan fled to the British consulate and demanded protection; had it been granted, Thailand would have become an Anglo-French protectorate in all but name. Britain and France, by refusing to support their consuls, treated the matter as an internal quarrel, and Chulalongkorn was able to bring about a resolution of the crisis. Peace, however, was bought at a high price, for the King's supporters were disbanded, the councils ceased to meet, and no further reforms were undertaken for a decade.</Text>

			<Text>One of the most notable reforms that occured during his reign was the centralisation of Siam. The six ministries of traditional Thai government had been omnicompetent, each with its own tax collections, law courts, provinces to administer, and rights to unsupervised expenditure; and they tended to be dominated by the minister of the North (mahatthai) and the minister of the South (kalahom), whom the King had been almost powerless to control. The new system, introduced on April 1, 1892, had 12 functionally defined ministries responsible to the King. Central to the reform program was the work of the ministry of interior, directed from 1892 by Prince Damrong Rajanubhab. By grouping almost 100 provinces into just 14 ""Monthon,"" Damrong was able to make effective use of a very small body of educated young men in rapidly strengthening Bangkok's control over hitherto semiautonomous provinces. As a result, state revenues doubled within 7 years, and the new administrative structure brought the rule of law, public works, and elementary public education to the most distant provinces by the turn of the century. Chulalongkorn's son Prince Rabi was appointed as minister of justice in 1896, and all Thai law was recodified along European lines by the end of the reign, and a centralized modern judicial system was introduced. Railway construction, financed until 1904 entirely out of current revenues, rapidly linked the country together as never before. The King took great care in choosing the men for these tasks and followed daily the progress of the work. He encouraged and supported the most able of them and gave them a free hand, while ever goading and criticizing the less decisive and mediocre.</Text>

			<Text>Until the 1880s Chulalongkorn generally could assume that he had the goodwill of the Western powers and counted on British support for Thai independence and upon the skillful diplomacy of Prince Devawongse, whose appointment as foreign minister in 1886 marked the resumption of reform. From the mid-1880s, however, French ambitions in Indochina began to clash with Thai rights of suzerainty over Laos. The Thai were powerless to halt the demands which escalated into the Franco-Thai War of 1893 and ended with French gunboats forcing their way up the Chaophraya River to Bangkok to demand the cession to France of the east bank of the Mekong River and the payment of a large indemnity. Britain, counted on to support the Thai, refused to intervene, and Laos was ceded to France.</Text>

			<Text>Chulalongkorn was disheartened and went into an almost year-long period of illness and depression. Once recovered, he began to take initiatives and responsibility he had earlier been more willing to share with his brothers. The Anglo-French Declaration of 1896 guaranteed the integrity of central Siam but left the northeast threatened by France and the south by Britain. Chulalongkorn's European tour of 1897 was, among other things, an attempt to secure new European interest in Thailand's continued independence, especially on the part of Russia and Germany. Whether the tour achieved this object or not, his reception by the European monarchs as an equal did give Chulalongkorn a new self-confidence and a realization that modernization did not necessarily mean Westernization: ""We must try to imitate what is good elsewhere, and at the same time not only to keep but to develop what is good and worthy of respect in our own national character and institutions,"" he declared upon his return.</Text>

			<Text>During the remainder of Chulalongkorn's reign rapid progress was made toward the resolution of Thailand's most serious problems in the field of foreign affairs. Small areas of Laos on the western bank of the Mekong and the western provinces of Cambodia were ceded to France in 1904 and 1907, and in return the Thai regained legal jurisdiction over French Asian subjects in Thailand. The cession to Britain of the four Malayan states of Kelantan, Trengganu, Kedah, and Perlis in 1909 brought Thailand similar legal concessions (although the abolition of extraterritoriality was still several decades away) and capital for the extension of the railways toward Singapore. Most of all, by the end of his reign the King could feel that his country's independence at last was secure.</Text>

			<Text>Chulalongkorn is perhaps best known in modern Thailand for his abolition of Siamese slavery. He associated the abolition of slavery in the United States with the bloodshed of the American Civil War. Chulalongkorn, to prevent such a bloodbath in Siam, provided several steps towards the abolition of slavery, not an extreme turning point from servitude to total freedom. Traditionally, Siamese slavery functioned differently from western slavery. Those who found themselves unable to live on their own sold themselves into slavery by rich noblemen. Likewise, when a debt was defaulted, the borrower would become a slave of the lender. If the debt was redeemed, the slave regained freedom. However, those whose parents were household slaves were bound to be slaves forever because their redemption price was extremely high. Because of economic conditions, people sold themselves into slavery in great numbers and in turn they produced a large number of household slaves. In 1867 they accounted for one-third of Siamese population. In 1874, Chulalongkorn enacted a law that lowered the redemption price of household slaves born in 1867 (his ascension year) and freed all of them when they had reached 21. The newly-freed slaves would have time to settle themselves as farmers or merchants so they would not become unemployed. In 1905, the Slave Abolition Act ended Siamese slavery in all forms.</Text>

			<Text>Especially in the 1880s, he was fond of traveling incognito and would wander the slums and streets of Bangkok at night clad as a peasant. He once stopped a royal procession to join, unannounced, a peasant wedding; and his numerous travel diaries are filled with recorded conversations with peasant farmers who told him local folklore or complained about local conditions. He was a man of broad interests, and his zeal for change did not diminish his appreciation of his country's traditions.</Text>

			<Text>After one of the longest reigns in Thai history, he died on Oct. 23, 1910. During his 42-year reign, King Chulalongkorn succeeded in establishing a government based on the western system, which ultimately paved the way for the present democracy. He reformed the rule of law, established a proper judicial system and introduced compulsory military service, improving the country's national defense. He introduced the Baht (still in use today) as the official currency and made taxes directly payable to the government, cutting out the corrupt middlemen. King Chulalongkorn also set up Siam's first hospital based on western medical practices, the first medical school and a nationwide education system. For his role in ensuring the continued sovereignty and for his modernization of Siam, Chulalongkorn remains to this day, one of the most highly revered monarchs in Thai history.</Text>
