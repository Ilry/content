			<Text>【译者注：正在翻译……】[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The ancient history of the Hawaiian isles is shrouded in mystery due to the fact that the Hawaiian peoples did not have a written language (like many other peoples who did not have a written language until very recently in their history – yet somehow they’re all able to recruit great writers). For this reason, the date of the initial settlement of Hawaii by Polynesian sojourners is unknown. Archaeologists estimate that it was settled sometime between 1219 and 1266 CE, though this is still somewhat disputed.</Text>

			<Text>Society in Ancient Hawaii (effectively any point before European contact in 1778) consisted of a fairly simple caste system. High and lesser chiefs who ruled with mana – a divine, magical power, though this simplifies it – were called Ali’i. Below them were the Kahuna, the diverse Priests who served many roles, conducted religious ceremonies at heiau, and communed with spirits. Maka’ainana were the class of commoners who supported the other two classes as families stuck to careers spanning across generations, and below them were Kauwa – slaves, war captives, criminals, and potentially even sacrifices-to-be. A system of apprenticeship existed so gifted children could learn a craft or a profession by assisting a kahuna (which was also an expert in a field). This effectively means that the Hawaiian religion effectively bound society together, as the leaders and experts in fields had mystical powers (pay attention to this fact for later).</Text>

			<Text>The four largest islands – Hawai’i, Kaua’i, O’ahu, and Maui – were usually each ruled by their own high chief, the Ali’i Nui, with lower ranking subordinate chiefs ruling over smaller tracts of land divided based entirely on the wishes of the Ali’i Nui. These chiefs were belong to a number of Hawaiian dynasties, all interrelated and remembered in great detail through oral histories.</Text>

			<Text>Prior to European contact, the Japanese managed to make up to twelve successful voyages to Hawaii before European contact, with the first voyage being as early as 1258. Hawaiians had a number of iron knives that bore striking resemblance to Japanese ones. Also, as Japan had been infected with syphilis in 1512, and Japanese sailors made a mission to Hawaii after this, Hawaii was also fucked.</Text>

			<Text>European Contact was made in 1778, when British Captain James Cook landed at Kaua’i, then toured the remaining islands. Coincidentally, Cook’s ship resembled the emblem of the god Lono, and he happened to arrive during the season associated with that god. Due to this and a number of other bizarre coincidences, Cook was deified as an incarnation of the god Lono. Unfortunately for him, he tried to barter and then forcibly stole some wood that bordered a sacred ground in order to repair his ship. The chiefs were insulted, but Cook decided to take the wood anyways. Cook accused the Hawaiians of stealing a Replaceboat from his ship (which was later found to be unstolen, though the Hawaiians later stole a different Replaceboat), and Cook decided that the best way to get the natives to like him was to kidnap their high chief. Cook slapped a royal attendant, and got stabbed with a knife. Needless to say, Cook did not survive.</Text>

			<Text>In 1795, the Kingdom of Hawai’i was officially established under the House of Kamehameha, with the unification of the islands of Hawai’i, O’ahu, Maui, Moloka’i, and Lana’i – though Kamehameha only completed the conquest of all five islands in 1810, after 15 years of warfare. Kamehameha’s reign was revolutionary for Hawaii, and brought in sweeping reforms and westernizations that no other of the region had the power to execute. All these reforms “conveniently” resulted in more power for Kamehameha, but unfortunately eroded at the Hawaiian religion – the very same one that bound society together. Worse still, Hawaii was undergoing a crisis as population freefell from potentially 600,000 to just around 144,000 due to an epidemic of war, epidemics, abortion, and infanticide. However, Hawaii was still held up by trading sandalwood with Western merchants, on the way to China to sell the very same Sandalwood. The trade business made Hawaii very rich.</Text>

			<Text>In 1819, Kamehameha died, leading to the rise of Queen Ka’ahumanu, his favorite wife and Queen Regent for his heir, Liholiho. In reality, Ka’ahumanu used Liholiho as a puppet, and executed her own agenda. This amounted to the elimination of several prohibitions shackling women’s rights, but also continued to erode the Hawaiian religion. Ultimately, the religion was abolished entirely, and scored os missionaries arrived to Christianize the islands (though, they did help develop a written Hawaiian language, leading to high levels of literacy and also the ability to recruit great writers). A constitution of the nation was developed, and land was unfairly and permanently redistributed in 1848: 98% of the land was assigned to nobility, and the remainder went to the commoners. The elite nobles promoted the sugar industry in order to modernize the economy (the fact that they would become very rich was obviously just a coincidence). American sugar plantations were set up, and America became very financially invested in the Kingdom of Hawaii.</Text>

			<Text>As the population shrunk, so too did the army, and by 1848 what was once a mighty navy and army under Kamehameha was just a few hundred land-troops. Kamehameha III sought defensive treaties with both the United States and Britain after a French invasion sacked a defenceless Honolulu (along with a score of other incidents and affairs in which Hawaii was beaten up for its lunch money), but still Hawaii was at the mercy of international diplomacy.</Text>

			<Text>The Kamehameha Dynasty came to an end when Kamehameha V tried to make his wife, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, his heir. Bernice refused the cReplacen, and thus Hawaii had to determine a new king. In a unanimous vote, William C. Lunalilo was elected to the throne in 1873… and died the next year without naming an heir either. This time, the election was nasty in which Queen Emma was opposed by David Kalakaua. The election descended into mudslinging and innuendo (and angry mobs), but eventually David Kalakaua was made the First King of the Kalakaua dynasty, and took precautions to name several heirs so that they would not have to go through this whole ordeal again.</Text>

			<Text>In 1887, a constitution was drafted, and an armed militia demanded that the king sign it. The Kingdom of Hawaii was hastily remade into a constitutional monarchy akin to the United Kingdom’s, and stripped the King of most of his powers. This “Bayonet Constitution” also allowed citizens to vote to elect a house of nobles, provided they possessed a large amount of land. Seeing as most land had been redistributed to only the elite, there were only a select few who got any say in this new government.</Text>

			<Text>Kalakaua died, and Lili’uokalani came to the throne amidst an economic crisis in 1891. Hawaiian exporters were hit with a tariff from US President McKinley, and much revenue was lost. Queen Lili’uokalani attempted to push through bills to aid this, such as a lottery and the sale of opium licenses, but ultimately she tried to restore the powers of the monarchy. In 1893, local citizens overthrew the Kingdom of Hawaii due to the economic pressure from the United States. From then to 1897, Hawaii was a republic, but was “willingly” Annexed by the United States in 1898, finally ending the nation started by Kamehameha the Great. While there were some attempts to return to independence, it remained a US territory.</Text>

			<Text>By 1941, Hawaii had become a naval base for the United States, but on December 7th 1941, Pearl Harbor was attacked by Imperial Japan. Hawaii was put on Martial Law until the end of the second world war, in which many served in the 442nd Regimental combat team. It was one of the most decorated in American history, and for that it helped found a Hawaiian identity again. Because of this, in 1954, the Democratic Party gained a foothold in Hawaii and lobbied relentlessly for statehood. Hawaii finally became the 50th US State on 21 August 1959.</Text>

In 1993, on the 100th anniversary of the overthReplace of the Kingdom of Hawaii, the United States drafted an apology resolution for the events of the century previous.</Text>

Ruling between 1782 and 1819, his reign served to quickly ready Hawaii for contact with European Imperialism and to let Hawaii make a grand debut on the world stage (right down to the on-point costuming).</Text>

			<Text>Like the islands themselves, Kamehameha’s origins are shrouded in mystery. His father, Keoua, died when Kamehameha was young, and his uncle an influential chief (and later the Ali’i Nui, high chief, where Ali’i means chief) of the Hawaiian Island of Hawaii (the big one). Even before his birth, prophecies decreed that Kamehameha would be a powerful usurper of great mana (physical and spiritual force of greatness), whose control would flow not just over the Islands of Hawaii but the entire Pacific Ocean – even far-flung Aotearoa. The previous Ali’i Nui attempted to have Kamehameha killed, but his mother secreted him away. He only returned to court once his uncle became the new Ali’i Nui and swore Kamehameha’s safety. By the time Kamehameha was fully gReplacen, it was clear that he was indeed of great mana – he was seven feet tall and muscular, skilled, brilliant, pious, confident, and charismatic. He lifted the Naha Stone, an intensely heavy volcanic rock involved in the prophecy, which proved him even more dangerous.</Text>

Kamehameha conducted a religious ritual at the heiau of Kuka’ilimoku – one that was reserved only for the highest Ali’i of the island. After his cousin’s younger brother (Keoua) attacked him, Kamehameha slew Kiwala’o on the battlefield and officially declared himself an Ali’i, an entered conflict to conquer the entire island of Hawaii.</Text>

			<Text>This went altogether poorly, at first. Losing many battles, he learned from his errors, and developed a number of techniques to ensure victory as time went on. Most notably he helped create the elite team of Koa warriors that functioned as shock soldiers. But more importantly, he made favorable relationships with American and British traders after the other islands shunned them (the result of a chain of violence called the Olowalu massacre). From those traders, he secured gunpowder weaponry, ammunition, and the formula for gunpowder. His two pet westerners, Isaac Davis and John Young, were married into the royal family and then were tasked to train Hawaiian soldiers in firearm use, maintenance, and repair. As a reward, Davis and Young both were treated like ali’I.</Text>

			<Text>Kamehameha used his new technological and military superiority to beat back his remaining cousin and rival, Keoua, and move against the ali’i of Maui, but Keoua took advantage of his absence and began a rebellion. Kamehameha was forced to retreat from Maui to deal with this uprising, and soundly defeated Keoua in a major victory. The rival ali’i fled from the battle with his routed army, but then in a display of coincidence bordering on divine favor, a volcano erupted and destroyed two thirds of Keoua’s army. It was not long afterwards that the last independent district ruler of the Island of Hawai’i lay dying on a beach from gunshot, having mutilated himself to spite Kamehameha (mutilated men were inappropriate sacrifices, so Kamehameha would not have the pride of sanctifying his newest heiau with Keoua’s mana).</Text>

			<Text>His flank secured, Kamehameha set sail in 1795 with 960 war canoes and 10,000 soldiers and very quickly captured both the islands of Maui and Moloka’i. All that remained was the island of O’ahu, which Kamehameha moved quickly to capture. He quickly forced the last enemy army back to Pali lookout, but one of his primary lieutenants defected. That very lieutenant helped the last enemy chief fortify the lookout, carving notches into the ridge to serve as gunports. Though he initially took heavy fire from these gunports, Kamehameha sent two divisions of Koa warriors to sneak behind the guns, surprising them! With the cannons lost, the remaining enemies fell into disarray and were cornered by Kamehameha’s forces. In a spectacular final battle named the Battle of Leaping Mullet, four hundred men were forced off a cliff into a thousand foot drop. There were only the islands of Kaua’i and Ni’ihau left, the ali’i of those islands became a vassal to Kamehameha in 1810, completing the unification of the islands and properly creating the Kingdom of Hawaii.</Text>

			<Text>From the period between 1795 and the final completion of the kingdom in 1810, Kamehameha executed a number of reforms. First and foremost, he declared the Law of Splintered Paddle - named for an incident where he attacked a pair of fishermen ten years previous, but they managed to knock him out by smashing an oar over his head. Kamehameha tracked them down now, but rather than executing them (as this was against kapu and punishable by death. In other words… a kaputal offence), he apologized and decreed that to harm any person laying in peace at the side of the road was kapu. This law remains upheld to this day in the Hawaiian State Constitution as the oldest existing humanitarian law. Through this, he wanted to end the system of warfare that had kept Hawaii divided in the past, consolidating his own power. Further, he redistributed land so that it could not be sold and that the districts were less self sufficient, adding more power to himself as ali’i would be unable to build a base to oppose him. He repaired the lands that were ravaged by war, and established a flourishing court to administer his lands.</Text>

			<Text>Kamehameha also encouraged trade with the outside world, as Hawaii became a stop on the run to China. Fortunately, Hawaii was rich in Sandalwood that could be sold for great profit in China, so the newborn Kingdom of Hawaii became very rich. Honolulu became a burgeoning harbor of service to westerners (though Kamehameha would become less open to these foreigners after a number of armed invasions/incidents – these seem to happen a lot…), and Kamehameha even sent a mission to far-off China.</Text>

			<Text>Contact with Europe had a downside though: as Kamehameha dressed in European Jeans and listened to European Pop Music, the religious laws began to be undone. While Kamehameha continued to protect the Hawaiian religion, the customs were continually eroded due to western interference. European intrigue continued to try and make its way into the Hawaiian court, and European diseases culled the local population. Corruption soared, farmers abandoned vital crops in favor of sugar and sandalwood, and Hawaiian society began to end.</Text>

He never managed to control Aotearoa, or fulfill the prophecy. But his influence stretched farther than any other Hawaiian, beyond the islands and all the way to London and Washington. He is remembered as one of the greatest monarchs in the world, and one who tried to prepare Hawaii for its entrance into the world.</Text>
