			<Text>【译者注：正在翻译……】[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Benjamin Franklin – his name has become almost synonymous with the colonial American period, and his writings are quoted in everyday life. Everyone knows ‘A penny saved is a penny earned’ and ‘an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure’, and Benjamin Franklin is most well known for the Lightning Kite anecdote (which I’ve heard no less than twelve times from other modders whilst writing this). But the man himself is a much deeper, and fatter, character. It was through his direct work that America became what it is today, and for that he is remembered as the most quintessentially American of the Founding Fathers.</Text>

			<Text>Franklin was born in Boston, Massachusetts as one of seventeen (!!!) of Josiah Franklin’s children. While his father wanted him to attend school with the clergy, he unfortunately had only enough money to send him to school for two years (that happens when you have seventeen children). However, his voracious reading and lifelong love of books took care of the rest. Soon after he was apprenticed to his brother James, who worked as a printer. It was here that both James and Ben founded the first truly independent newspaper in the thirteen colonies – the New England Courant. It was here that he adopted the pseudonym of Silence Dogood, after his brother didn’t let him write in the paper. Silence Dogood was, supposedly, a middle-aged widow with the sharpest tongue in the colonies, and the letters from ‘her’ in the paper became the talk of Boston. Supposedly, James Franklin was annoyed when he found out his little brother Ben was the author of these articles (though, being a brother, he was likely annoyed with him to begin with). It’s from here that Franklin gained a strong advocacy for free speech. His brother was jailed for publishing material unflattering to the governor, and subsequently Mrs. Dogood proclaimed that the governor was oppressing them all. Then, Franklin was kicked out of Massachusetts.</Text>

			<Text>Having escaped the law to Philadelphia, he began work in several printer shops. After a number of unsuccessful jobs and a brief stint in London, he returned to work as a clerk, shopkeeper, and bookkeeper. But a year after this, he set up the Junto – a discussion group for artisans and tradesmen, modeled after the coffeehouses that Franklin encountered in England. It was essentially a bookclub, but since the books needed were incredibly expensive, he had the members pool their funds, and thereby created the first subscription library. It soon thereafter became a center of the Enlightenment in the colonies, and persist today as a great scholarly and research library.</Text>

			<Text>In Philadelphia, Benjamin continued his work as a newspaperman, becoming the publisher of the Pennsylvania Gazette. Through this, his commentary was disseminated to the populace, earning esteem with the colonies and helping instruct his peers in virtue. But most importantly, he used this venue as a way to influence the colonist hearts and minds. He was often busy with his scientific endeavors - work on electricity, heating, materials, optics, climate, and population – and therefore the gazette remained poorly published for the remainder of his tenure, and his efforts to set up intercolonial publishing offices failed.</Text>

			<Text>Speaking of his scientific endeavors, his primary efforts were always in the fields of electricity and optics. He famously conducted the kite experiment (However, he was not struck by lightning. If he was, he would have died. Instead the kite picked up residual electricity during a storm, managing to charge a primitive battery and give Franklin a slight shock), and also invented the bifocal lens, in addition to supporting the wave theory of light (at the time, it was fiercely unpopular, and only Franklin and Euler backed it, to the mockery of the rest of the scientific community. However, seeing as we remember Franklin and Euler’s names instead of the other guys, it’s clear to see who really won). However, his most important discoveries were on the subjects of meteorology and the currents of the North Atlantic. While they were his most important discoveries, they were also rather technical, so we won’t get into them. Suffice to say that while it took several decades to be properly implemented by sailors, it did aid in cutting down the time of the transatlantic trip by two weeks.</Text>

			<Text>As Franklin aged, he became more involved with public life. While printing earnt him his fame, he retired from the Gazette in 1747 as a wealthy man, and eventually became involved Philadelphian politics: by 1753, he was appointed deputy postmaster-general of all of British North America. Using his position, he was able to found a number of public services: the first volunteer firefighting service, the first hospital in what would become the united states, the first homeowner’s insurance company, and many new-model colleges. Franklin, using his expertise, printed new textbooks for these universities that would train people in professions rather than faith, and in English rather than Latin. After being drafted by the colonies to improve the relations with the Natives and in defence against the French, he proposed a broad Plan of Union for the colonies in 1754. This was almost immediately discarded, though some of the concepts would eventually end up in the Articles of Confederation and the US Constitution.</Text>

			<Text>After having collected a number of honorary degrees from many universities (including but not limited to: Yale, Harvard, St. Andrews, Oxford, and William and Mary), he was brought to London in 1757 as a colonial agent. His mission: protest the political influence of the Penn family on behalf of Pennsylvania. Did he succeed? Nope. His lack of influential allies spelt the end of this mission (though it was also in London that he earnt notoriety as a womanizer). In 1765, he returned to London to oppose the Stamp Act, but was entirely unable to prevent his passage. After only one very brief incident where Philadelphians threatened to burn down his house (the City of Brotherly Love, everyone), he gave a testimony that lead to the outright repeal of the despised bill.</Text>

			<Text>This event made Franklin the de-facto spokesman for Colonial interests in England, using newspapers to print his essays on behalf of the colonies. However, he was regarded by the British as a fomenter of serious trouble, and he was systematically humiliated in front of the Privy Council after trying to find a peaceful solution in 1774. Getting booted unceremoniously out of Britain, he returned home in 1775 to find the colonies up in arms: the American Revolution was in full swing.</Text>

			<Text>Pennsylvania unanimously chose Franklin as their delegate to the Second Constitutional Convention (having missed the first one), and there he famously aided in drafting the Declaration of Independence. After having signed the legendary document, he was appointed the first United States Postmaster General, and established the new Colonial post system, which eventually became the United States Post Office.</Text>

			<Text>Having also been drafted into becoming the Ambassador to France, he travelled to Paris in 1776. There, he succeeded in gaining an alliance with France, and in 1785 helped broker the Treaty of Paris that would end the American revolution. He returned home to Philadelphia, where he was drafted once more, this time to serve as the President of Pennsylvania during the articles of Confederation. He was acclaimed as a hero, second only to George Washington in stature. It was also during this time that Franklin became a staunch abolitionist, and freed his slaves. He also advocated the education of black slaves in Philadelphia.</Text>

			<Text>Throughout his life, he suffered obesity and later gout, and in 1790 Benjamin Franklin died in his home in Philadelphia. His last words were allegedly, “a dying man can do nothing easy,” as it was becoming difficult for him to breathe. Approximately 20,000 people attended the hero’s funeral, and he was buried with his wife at the Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia.</Text>

			<Text>To this day, Benjamin Franklin is remembered for his humility, work ethic, wisdom, and scathing wit, in addition to his accomplishments during his 84 years of life. He remains as one of the few founding fathers to have never held the office of President of the United States (and only because he died before he had the chance to be very likely drafted into it), and his mark can be felt across the United States even today.</Text>
