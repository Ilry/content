Created for Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together.

The DST version can be found in the [Workshop here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2189004162).

Think of [Show Me](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=666155465), but with more of everything.
Displays stuff like health, damage, fuel, food stats, follower info, naughtiness values, and almost everything I can think of.

I made this source public to help people who might be trying to figure out how to make mods on their own. **Read the license for more information.**

# Reporting issues

When reporting an issue, please provide your relevant materials such as your crash log(s), screenshots, reproduction steps, and/or anything else that you think would help. If I don't have that information, I am more likely to chalk it up to user error and will take longer to respond.
