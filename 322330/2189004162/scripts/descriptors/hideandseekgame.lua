-- GetDistanceSqToPoint returns squared wall distance
-- so if the hiding range is 30 (KITCOONDEN_HIDEANDSEEK_HIDING_RADIUS_MAX), :FindEntities returns all entities within 30 units
-- the minimum range is KITCOONDEN_HIDEANDSEEK_HIDING_RADIUS_MIN_SQ, which is 5*5, so things have to be at least 5 units away
